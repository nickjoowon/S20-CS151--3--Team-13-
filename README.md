# S20-CS151--3--Team-13--Clinical Information System Project


Implemented a clinical information system using Java to handle various tasks: 
Registering new patient, view existing patients, adding audiological evaluation, adding new visits, and scheduling the next visit.


To test the code, run the main method in PatientController.
